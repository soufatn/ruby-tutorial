Using Sauce Labs with Ruby
============

So you’ve decided to functional test your web app.  That’s fantastic
news!  We’re here to help.  We’re going to assume you’re using Ruby on
Rails (v 3.2), and you don’t have any tests yet. We recommend RSpec
and Capybara, but Sauce Labs also works great with straight webdriver
instead of Capybara, and other frameworks like Test::Unit, Cucumber,
etc.
